# Personal Portfolio

This project is to showcase projects you have completed in a pleasing and easy to view manner.

Steps taken

1. created a general outline for the HTML and the CSS.
2. made the HTML simple and easy to read.
3. wrote an about me section that describes my background and gives a little bit of personal information about who I am
4. inserted flexboxes to house the projects and display the name
5. styled the flexboxes to have them centered on the page and the same distances from eachtother

Overall the idea was to keep this page very simple and easy to navigate. The links at the top will direct to the section they are referencing.
